Hi! I created a city guide using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The following main functions are implemented on the site:

Using the API to get information about places.
Creating a carousel of images using JavaScript.
Development of an interactive calendar for displaying events and events.
Using Bootstrap to create a modern and responsive design.
This project is my first attempt at web development, and I am constantly working to improve it. I will be glad to receive your feedback and suggestions on how to make it even better. Thanks for your attention!
